# PageRank Project

This project implements the PageRank algorithm to rank web pages by importance using two approaches: a sampling method with the Markov Chain random surfer model and an iterative method with a recursive mathematical expression.

## Key Features

- **Transition Model**: Computes the probability distribution for the next page a random surfer visits.
- **Sampling PageRank**: Estimates PageRank by simulating random surfer behavior.
- **Iterative PageRank**: Calculates PageRank values through repeated application of the PageRank formula until convergence.
